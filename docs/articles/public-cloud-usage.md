# Can I do anything to reduce my already slim cloud costs?

_February 2023_

It might be possible, with a little work. Or, with a lot of work.

It appears there's a grown interest in overall cost reduction and, among other things, companies are scrutinizing their cloud usage more closely. Even those who have maintained strict controls over cloud costs are now attempting to discover new and innovative methods to further reduce their expenses.

Based on questions I've received and seen recently, I've made a list (well, lists actually) of things that can be done to optimize cloud deployments.

I'll also immediately apologize since there's a high probability none of the ideas will be plug and play and there's a lot of "it depends" at play.

But hopefully this can spark some ideas and open new avenues for you to explore.

I've divided the possible improvements into 3 areas: Basic, infrastructure, application.
