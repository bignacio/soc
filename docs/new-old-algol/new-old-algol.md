# New Old Algorithms

I was thinking about some of the algorithms behind technologies everyone has been talking about but that don't come up as often on conversations as binary search or depth-first tree walk.

And then I decided to learn more about them, by coding and writing about them. The first series will be on statistical algorithms, you know, some of the things behind machine learning techniques.
